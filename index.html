        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           My name is Antai Okon-Otoyo and my AltSchool ID is <span style="color: deepskyblue;">ALT/SOE/024/0530</span>. I'm a technical support engineer in a global fintech organisation with HQ based in Nigeria.<br><br>
           I'm currently training to be a Cloud Engineer at AltSchool with the aim of becoming a skilled professional across the major cloud technologies and automation tools.

        <h2>Goals for Cloud Engineering Track</h2>
        <p>My goal is to graduate from AltSchool as a skilled cloud engineer proficient in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud platforms and services.</p>
        <p>Since I begun my journey at AltSchool,  my goal has being to learn from the best hands in the cloud engineering and devops field.<br><br>

        Currently, we're about to round up from the first semester where the basics of computer science and programming have been taught to us effectively and I can testify that every angle way covered holistically and properly.<br><br>

        We were able to cover semantic HTML where I learnt new things I had not covered before in HTML. CSS came with its own surprises as well because I normally brush through it when I've to learn but AltSchool gave me a new perspective.<br><br>

        I wondered how JavaScript was going to be covered knowing that it can be bulky and I can say Rising did justice to it. Even though it was long, it definitely covered all that was needed. I'm grateful to be part of this journey and I can't wait to see what the next phase entails.</p>
